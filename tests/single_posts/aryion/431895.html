			<div class="content"><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: 116%;">NEW UPDATE:</span>: some stuff on the last page.<br/><br/><br/><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: 116%;">old updates </span>:  well, I'm going off for a week and leaving this poll. Generally only thinkning of macro / micro stuff at the moment and if I missed anything, just put it there. The levels going to be based around the pred, too (giant village for giantess and such) so I guess the poll makes some difference to the outcome.<br/><br/>now with breast vore (and updated pet engine- 120 lines o' script on that pet) A little more to go before I can say its far enough to be ver 1.0<br/><br/>Pets skins, new movement and a gun. <span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: 116%;">WASD to move L/R arrow keys to attack </span> if you make it out of the UB scene (mouse bashing ahead) you get to be dinoman, yes dinoman. Also, some annoying pet (I've done some fixing to get this working properly, post if anything goes wrong) which nom's on enemies. Gun added makes the game extremely easy, as does the pet, so expect enemies to much harder next time round. Also, apart from becoming dinoman, there are no new vore scenes :c<br/><br/> was an RPG, <span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: 116%;">now a platformer</span>. also made scenes easier to get to and added a second meter.. which doesnt go anywhere yet. (also some crazy challenge could be to kill anything using a bare fist at lv1... I got the jungle one, but I'm starting to doubt the one in cave's even possible)<br/> to attackupdate to engine.<br/><br/> added more to the UB scene, still has work to do on it, no links in the new parts yet, other than clicking on the bottom of the sceen to change area, but there will be soon.<br/><br/>Fairly small. Yes, animated UB scene, well the start of it, also cum-o-meter where lag probably helps button mashing slightly. Nothing past this <span style="font-style: italic">yet</span>, so when you reach the line at the top, you get linked to back to the first fight.<br/><br/> so I got unlazy for a for a bit... (unfinished) start of UB scene (after you get back out)- no animation for it yet, you can jump (in cave)-<span style="font-size: 120%; line-height: 116%;"> hold down up to jump</span>, stomach acid added (someone asked for this?), your HP drops while your inside (but you cant die there... yet). quality change buttons added, this will make it look ugly  <img src="./images/smilies/sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad"/>  but will reduce lag, <span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: 116%;">if lag continues, especially during the vore scene, try to make the screen or flash player smaller </span> I think thats it.<br/><br/>unequip fixed, magical power added: (megid, has 1/4 chance of 1hit ko, it looks lame and doesnt do much at the moment 'I'll work on this) can change hair(the brown and blue colour boxes at the start) again, ideas on hair accessories (tophat and monacle, maybe) would be usefull.<br/><br/>Fixed -&gt;now you can controll movement in the cave by left / right keys. <span style="font-size: 130%; line-height: 116%;">Right click, play to skip this</span>. moan if I should iether change which keys are for movement (L/R/U/D for W/A/S/D etc. or arrows for movement)<br/><br/>Currently working on: Vore scene + techniques/magic junk+ customizable chars <div style="padding: 3px; background-color: #FFFFFF; border: 1px solid #d8d8d8; font-size: 1em;"><div style="text-transform: uppercase; border-bottom: 1px solid #CCCCCC; margin-bottom: 3px; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; display: block;"><span onclick="if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') {  this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerHTML = '&lt;b&gt;Spoiler: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href=\'#\' onClick=\'return false;\'&gt;hide&lt;/a&gt;'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerHTML = '&lt;b&gt;Spoiler: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href=\'#\' onClick=\'return false;\'&gt;show&lt;/a&gt;'; }"/><b>Spoiler: </b><a href="#" onclick="return false;">show</a></div><div class="quotecontent"><div style="display: none;">gts for gts vore scene</div></div></div> <img src="./images/smilies/silly.gif" alt=":silly:" title="Silly"/>   ^- yes, I'm still working on this<br/><br/>So, I'm making a new flash vore game. anyway, as I said before somewhere,<blockquote class="uncited"><div>....... ok, its official then, I'm making a flash RPG/semi realtime RPG depending on how lazy I am I've got a good base, a character design and an enemy or so (also a vore scene already made) and a few backgrounds, music made exclusively for a game I never made and one of the worlds best flash scripters at hand (though he's a good freind and I cant bring myself to say I'm a voraphile, so I probably wont ask for help on this)... just need a few opinions on how to make it, I guess considering its made for a community this time...<br/>(also this means I'm out of the colab)</div></blockquote><br/>anyway, its at the earliest stages, and is currently just a simple RPG format, as my AS skills suck due to not actually doing any for over a year. Normally I wouldnt release this (yet) publically but I'll need opinions before I get into making anything and more importantly (for now) how it should be made. Due to being lazy, I'm thinking of making of making it fairly similar to Dragon Fable (contact enemy encounters are pretty easy). Difference is, you can mash the attack button rather than wait for a <span style="font-size: 20%; line-height: 116%;">lame</span> animation. (exp tnl stands for expierience to next lv, seems easier than working it out) you can also right click to 'cheat' but I'll remove this when its passed basic testing.<br/>need to work on that walking animation(doing this properly before I make the character human controlled)<br/>colourfull... thing button means you leveled<br/>that 'dont use this...' weapons just in for the alpha, I'll nerf it later<br/>Enemy doesnt get stronger yet<br/>will add more enemies and bosses, your opinions between what happens here- this may relate to the current only vore scene in there atm, might make it iether a press this button within x time limit to avoid vore <span style="font-size: 85%; line-height: 116%;">(like anyone would want to do that)</span> or inevitable, or a ' fight to get out' or a stage inside the host, the list goes on...</div>
