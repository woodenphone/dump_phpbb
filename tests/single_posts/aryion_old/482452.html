			<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>BB wrote:</cite>lol this is very good. If u play it backward it actually looks just like she is giving birth instead of unbirthing (which makes sence lol) but it works perfectly either way that is what i found funny.</div></blockquote><br/><br/>Thanks!  I never actually tried this backwards to see what it looks like, but I'll take your word for it.  In my mind, birth and unbirth are not exact reverses of each other, but my drawing and animation skills aren't good enough to make that apparent.<br/><br/>What's not exactly backwards is that the woman's vaginal muscles play an active role in unbirth.   The process starts when the victim ("you") are inserted (feet-first here, otherwise the video would have been pretty darn short!).  The uterus relaxes and expands, the birth canal is already relaxed, and the cervix is dilated.<br/><br/>When you're inside up to your neck, the woman rests for a bit.  Everything from here on is solely up to her.  She uses her abdominal muscles and diaphragm to expand her uterus, creating suction and pulling you inward, but the first two attempts don't work, and she has to stop and catch her breath.  On the third try, she feels some progress, and her midwife tells her to hold it as long as she can.  The entrance of her vagina slips up and over your chin, and your head quickly pops into her birth canal.  Whew.<br/><br/>She's uncomfortable, unable to bring her legs together or stand up.  Her midwife holds her feet and legs for her.<br/><br/>After another rest, the very outer ring of vaginal muscles tighten down-- closing up that hole and forcing you deeper inside.  As you travel inside, more muscles come into play at each contraction.  The birth canal lengthens and narrows.  At the peak of the contraction it may close up almost completely.  When she rests it relaxes again, allowing a tantalizing, frustrating view of the the outside and even the feeling of fresh air -- but is no longer large enough for you to pass through.<br/><br/>As your body curls up into her womb, she is pushing you "up"-- toward her front, so the birth canal is no longer a straight passageway.  As she moves you further in, you can still see the reflected light off the inside of her vaginal walls but can no longer see the outside world.  The outer portion of the vagina is returning to its normal size and no longer opens up, even during "rests".  She brings her legs together, closing her labia and increasing the pressure on your head. You move deeper inside, completely into her womb.  The inner portion of her vagina contracts, returning to its normal shape and size -- its role as a birth canal is over.  Her cervix swells up and then closes over your head.</div>
