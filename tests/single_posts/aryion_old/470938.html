			<div class="content">Thanks, everyone!   That didn't take "too" long, and was fun to work on.  The limitations on 2D animation are a "pain", but it some ways make it interesting.  If I was doing this in 3D I'd have spent a lot longer building the models and "set", but after that not much actually moves other than the camera.  Make the models anatomically accurate and put the camera in the right place and... well, there you go.<br/><br/>2D, however, makes you think about things-- almost like you do if you were going to describe it for a story.  I took "poetic" license here such that we turn to see the outside as we're being swallowed.  What do a woman's legs look like when you're stuck between them?  Do the insides of her thighs block the view of her knees?  Which side of her legs do you see?  How far away would her feet appear?  At what point (and for how long) would you see her labia?</div>
